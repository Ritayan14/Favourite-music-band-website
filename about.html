        Polyphia is a primarily instrumental progressive rock band based in
        Plano, Texas, formed in 2010. The group consists of guitarists Tim
        Henson and Scott LePage, bassist Clay Gober, and drummer Clay
        Aeschliman.Polyphia's sound is noted for incorporating virtuosic guitar
        parts with other styles of music.[1] Initially rooted in a metal-focused
        tone in their early releases, the band's music evolved to a more
        progressive rock sound in their later productions, combining electronic
        music and hip hop. Polyphia has released four studio albums, two EPs,
        and numerous singles. Their fourth album, Remember That You Will Die,
        released in October 2022, was the first to chart, debuting at number 33
        on the Billboard 200.
